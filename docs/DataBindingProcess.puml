actor User
boundary "View\n(XAML UI)" as View
control "ViewModel" as ViewModel
entity "Model" as Model
database "Data Service" as Service

== Initial Data Load ==

ViewModel -> Service : Request data
Service -> Model : Create/populate models
Service --> ViewModel : Return model data
ViewModel -> ViewModel : Set properties with data
ViewModel --> View : Property changed events
View --> User : Display updated UI

== User Input ==

User -> View : Interacts with UI element
View -> ViewModel : Command executes or\nproperty updates
ViewModel -> ViewModel : Process data
ViewModel -> Service : Update data if needed
ViewModel -> ViewModel : Update properties
ViewModel --> View : Property changed events
View --> User : Display updated UI

== Data Binding Types ==

note right of View
  **Binding Types**
  
  OneTime:
  - Source → Target (once)
  - Examples: Static text, initial setup
  
  OneWay:
  - Source → Target
  - Updates when source changes
  - Examples: Display values, status indicators
  
  TwoWay:
  - Source ↔ Target
  - Updates in both directions
  - Examples: Form fields, user input
  
  OneWayToSource:
  - Target → Source
  - Examples: Special user input scenarios
end note

== Binding Events Flow ==

box "MVVM Binding Mechanism" #LightBlue
participant View
participant "Binding Object" as Binding
participant ViewModel
end box

View -> Binding : Create binding
Binding -> ViewModel : Subscribe to PropertyChanged
ViewModel -> ViewModel : Update property
ViewModel -> Binding : Raise PropertyChanged
Binding -> View : Update UI

== Command Execution Flow ==

box "MVVM Command Flow" #LightGreen
participant View
participant "Command Object" as Command
participant ViewModel
end box

View -> Command : Execute
Command -> Command : Check CanExecute
Command -> ViewModel : Execute action
ViewModel -> ViewModel : Process data
ViewModel -> ViewModel : Update properties
ViewModel -> View : PropertyChanged events
